# Petco Scraper
<p>
  I decided to do a small scrape on Petco's website, specifically wet dog food. The main objective of this scraper was to practice scraping ecommerce stores.
  
  You can modify the code to get the necessary links. In this notebook I only scraped from 5 out of 708 links. 
  The scraper is rather slow but this can also be modified. 
  
  ### Tools I used:
  <ul>
    <li>Selenium</li>
    <li>tqdm</li>
  </ul>
  
  Website I scraped: https://www.petco.com/
